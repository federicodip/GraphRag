0,"How did the Babylonian period relations influence the tooth counts of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism, specifically for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn?","The Babylonian period relations influenced the tooth counts of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism by providing the basis for the mathematical calculations used to determine the gear sizes and ratios for the mechanisms. For Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, specific period relations were chosen based on their accuracy and suitability for creating the gear systems needed for the planetary mechanisms. These period relations were selected to ensure that the gear sizes and ratios matched the planetary motions accurately. The tooth counts of the gears were determined based on these period relations to create functional and accurate mechanisms for tracking the movements of the planets. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The tooth counts of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism directly reflect the Babylonian period relations, according to Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"". For Mars, a period relation of (37, -79) was chosen due to its accuracy, resulting in suitable tooth counts for the gears. For Jupiter, the most accurate period relation was chosen, while for Saturn, a 59-year period was selected for its greater accuracy compared to a 29-year period. For Venus, the mechanism uses an 8-year cycle with 5 synodic periods, referred to as (5, 8), which is scaled up to (40, 64) to make the tooth counts reasonable. The text does not provide specific information on the period relation or tooth counts for Mercury.",8
1,"What is the significance of the design simplicity and economy in the new mechanisms for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism, and how do they differ from previous models based on deferent and epicycle theories?","The significance of the design simplicity and economy in the new mechanisms for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism is that they provide an elegant solution to a long-standing problem. These new mechanisms are unlike previous models based on deferent and epicycle theories because they are based closely on the lunar anomaly mechanism. This design is surprising and unexpected because it works for both the lunar anomaly and the planets, even though the causes of the anomalies are different. The unity in design between the lunar anomaly and the planets reflects a unified solution, providing an economical and elegant way to model the motions of the superior planets. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The new mechanisms for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism, as proposed by Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones, are significant due to their simplicity and economy. Unlike previous models that directly modeled the deferent and epicycle theories, these new mechanisms are based closely on the lunar anomaly mechanism. They consist of just four gears, including an epicyclic gear with a pin on its face and a second epicyclic gear, which rotates on an eccentric epicyclic axis and has a slot in its face that engages with the pin. This design simplicity and economy align with the overall design of the Antikythera Mechanism, which is believed to be a mathematician's instrument based on arithmetic cycles and the geometric theories of its time.",10
2,"How were the superior planet mechanisms integrated into the Antikythera Mechanism, and what challenges did the design face in terms of interference and mechanical constraints?","The superior planet mechanisms were integrated into the Antikythera Mechanism using a pin-and-slot device. This design faced challenges in terms of interference and mechanical constraints due to the complexity of the planetary movements and the need to accurately represent them within the mechanism. The pin-and-slot device allowed for the necessary movements to be replicated mechanically, but the design had to be carefully implemented to avoid issues with interference and ensure the proper functioning of the mechanism. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The integration of superior planet mechanisms into the Antikythera Mechanism presented significant challenges, as described by Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism."" Unlike the inferior planets, the superior planets are not restricted to a fixed number of degrees from the Sun, creating difficulties when attempting to model these planets with slotted followers on the central axis. The addition of the inferior planet mechanisms to the main drive wheel (b1) also created more difficulties in arranging for both the 0-input and the 1-input to the superior planet mechanisms, as the inferior planet mechanisms interfered with the design. Despite these challenges, Freeth and Jones proposed a model that provided an elegant solution to these problems, based closely on the lunar anomaly mechanism.",7
3,In what ways did the new model for the superior planet mechanisms align with the astronomical knowledge of the era and the surviving evidence from the Antikythera Mechanism?,"The new model for the superior planet mechanisms proposed in the study aligns with the astronomical knowledge of the era by using mechanisms based on ancient Greek models of planetary motion, such as the ""deferent-and-epicycle"" and ""eccentre"" models. These models were used to explain the nonuniform motion of the planets, which was observed in antiquity. The proposed mechanisms for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism are based on the known mechanization of the lunar anomaly at the back of the device. Surprisingly, these models for the superior planets look exactly the same as the lunar anomaly mechanism, indicating a consistent design approach in the Mechanism. Despite the lack of physical evidence due to the loss of material in the fragments, the new model provides an elegant and harmonious solution that fits with the existing gear trains and the design virtuosity of the Antikythera Mechanism. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The new model for the superior planet mechanisms proposed by Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in their paper ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"" aligns with the astronomical knowledge of the era and the surviving evidence from the Antikythera Mechanism in several ways. The model is based on the known mechanization of the lunar anomaly at the back of the Antikythera Mechanism and is designed to mimic the geometrical models of the time. It provides an explanation for the existence of bearings and fittings on the Main Drive Wheel, as well as the mysterious pillars attached to its circumference. The model also accounts for the dimensions of the pillars. Furthermore, it is designed to show how all five planets can be included in the Antikythera Mechanism in a way that conforms to the observed data and explains several previously unresolved pieces of evidence. The model's superior planet mechanisms are based closely on the lunar anomaly mechanism, providing an economical and elegant solution that is in harmony with the design virtuosity of the existing gear trains.",10
4,"How did the tooth counts and gear sizes of the fixed input gears for the superior planets reflect the period relations from Babylonian astronomy, and how were these gears arranged in size order for assembly in the Antikythera Mechanism?","The tooth counts and gear sizes of the fixed input gears for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism were chosen to reflect the period relations from Babylonian astronomy. The fixed input gears were arranged in size order for assembly based on the chosen period relations. For example, the largest fixed gear for Jupiter was selected based on a specific period relation, such as (76, -83), to ensure accuracy. The order of the fixed inputs, from the front of the Mechanism to the back, was arranged to match the planetary order of the pointers. In this case, the order was Jupiter, Saturn, Mars. The output gears were arranged in a different order, reflecting the ordering of the pointers from front to back: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. This arrangement was necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the gear system within the Antikythera Mechanism. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The tooth counts and gear sizes of the fixed input gears for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism directly reflected the period relations from Babylonian astronomy, according to Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"". For example, the mechanism for Mars contained four gears: the fixed input gear G1, the pin gear G2, the slot gear G3, and the output gear G4. The tooth counts of G1 and G2 represented a Babylonian period relation for Mars. The surviving gears in the mechanism had tooth counts ranging from 15 to 225 teeth, limiting the consideration of period relations to numbers within this range. The exact arrangement of these gears in size order for assembly in the Antikythera Mechanism is not specified in the provided context.",7
5,"What was the rationale behind the placement and order of the outputs for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism, and how did this influence the design and assembly of the planetary mechanisms on the Superior Planet Plate?","The rationale behind the placement and order of the outputs for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism was based on achieving accuracy in representing the planetary positions. The order of the outputs was determined by the period relations chosen for each planet, with the largest fixed gear for Jupiter, followed by Saturn and Mars. The output gears were arranged in the order Saturn, Jupiter, Mars to reflect the planetary order of the pointers on the mechanism. This influenced the design and assembly of the planetary mechanisms on the Superior Planet Plate by ensuring that the gears and tubes were arranged in a specific order to accurately represent the planetary positions as observed from Earth. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The placement and order of the outputs for the superior planets in the Antikythera Mechanism were influenced by the planets' respective distances from the Earth, according to Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in their paper ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"". Saturn, being the furthest from the Earth, had its output gear closest to the front of the Mechanism, followed by Jupiter and then Mars. This arrangement resulted in varying heights for the bridges for the superior planet mechanisms, with Saturn's being the lowest, followed by Jupiter and Mars. This design and assembly was incorporated into the Superior Planet Plate, fitting into the space between the Date Plate and the Superior Planet Plate.",4
6,"How did the bridges for the superior planet mechanisms vary in height and design, and what mechanical constraints influenced the positioning of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in the assembly of the Antikythera Mechanism?","The bridges for the superior planet mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism were designed to vary in height to accommodate the different planetary mechanisms for Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. The positioning of these planets in the assembly was influenced by mechanical constraints related to the fixed gear sizes and the output gears. The fixed gear for Jupiter was the largest, and the order of the fixed inputs from front to back was Jupiter, Saturn, Mars. The output gears, from front to back, were Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. This arrangement was chosen to reflect the planetary order of the pointers on the mechanism. The different orders of the fixed sub-plate gears and the output gears were not a problem but required mechanical arrangements to ensure the output gear was at the right level. The constraints of the output tube system also played a role in determining the positioning of the planets in the assembly. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The bridges for the superior planet mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism varied in height with Saturn being the lowest, followed by Jupiter and Mars. The positioning of these planets was influenced by the space allowed by the Date Plate. Saturn was arranged to fit right in front of the Date Plate because the bridges for Jupiter and Mars were too high to fit within the space allowed by the Date Plate. The fixed gears for these superior planet mechanisms were attached to the Front Sub-Plate, with the gear for Jupiter being the largest and closest to the plate, followed by Saturn and Mars. This information is based on the work of Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"" (ISAW Papers 4, February 2012).",4
7,"What was the role of the Front Sub-Plate in holding the fixed gears for the superior planets, and how did its design and attachment to the Sub-Frame contribute to the overall functionality of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism?","The Front Sub-Plate in the Antikythera Mechanism held the fixed gears for the superior planets, specifically Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The design and attachment of the Front Sub-Plate to the Sub-Frame were crucial for the overall functionality of the planetary mechanisms. The fixed gears on the Front Sub-Plate were essential for the accurate calculation of the planetary positions. The attachment to the Sub-Frame ensured stability and alignment, allowing the gears to mesh correctly and transmit motion accurately through the gear trains. This precise alignment and stability were necessary for the proper functioning of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The Front Sub-Plate in the Antikythera Mechanism played a crucial role in holding the fixed gears for the superior planets. According to Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism"" (ISAW Papers 4, February 2012), the fixed inputs to the planetary mechanisms were all attached to this Front Sub-Plate, which was fixed to the wooden Sub-Frame. This arrangement provided the 0-input to the mechanisms. The input gears were stacked in size order, with the largest being closest to the plate, and they all had a hole of 14.4 mm diameter to allow the planetary outputs to pass through on their way to the Front Dials. This design and attachment to the Sub-Frame contributed to the overall functionality of the planetary mechanisms by enabling them to be set at any angle for calibration, thus enhancing the versatility and accuracy of the Antikythera Mechanism.",10
8,"How did the integration of the new superior planet mechanisms, along with the inferior planet mechanisms and solar anomaly mechanism, contribute to the overall complexity and accuracy of the planetary motion representation in the Antikythera Mechanism?","The integration of the new superior planet mechanisms, along with the inferior planet mechanisms and solar anomaly mechanism, contributed to the overall complexity and accuracy of the planetary motion representation in the Antikythera Mechanism by providing a more comprehensive and detailed model of the movements of the planets. The inclusion of mechanisms for the superior planets, which were more challenging to model due to their varying distances from the Earth, added a layer of sophistication to the representation. By incorporating these mechanisms, the Antikythera Mechanism was able to more accurately depict the nonuniform motions of the planets, including prograde and retrograde movements, enhancing the overall accuracy and complexity of the planetary motion representation. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The integration of the superior planet mechanisms, along with the inferior planet mechanisms and solar anomaly mechanism, added complexity to the Antikythera Mechanism but also increased its accuracy in representing planetary motion. The superior planets were not restricted to a fixed number of degrees from the Sun, which created difficulties when trying to model these planets with slotted followers on the central axis. However, the inclusion of these mechanisms provided an elegant solution to the problem of how the superior planets might have been shown in the Antikythera Mechanism. Wright demonstrated the feasibility of including all five planets in the Antikythera Mechanism using the same technology and engineering found in the surviving fragments. The study by Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones concluded that the Antikythera Mechanism almost certainly calculated the motions of all five planets known in ancient times. The front display incorporated revolving pointers bearing little spheres to represent all five planets making their apparent motions around the Earth. The gearwork of the mechanism mimicked the geometrical model that could account for the varying apparent speeds of the Sun and Moon, the limits of Venus' and Mercury's elongation from the Sun, and the retrogradations of all the planets.",10
9,"How did the design and assembly of the planet module, including the superior planet mechanisms, the SPP, and the Front Sub-Plate, contribute to the overall functionality and accuracy of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism?","The design and assembly of the planet module, including the superior planet mechanisms, the SPP, and the Front Sub-Plate, contributed to the overall functionality and accuracy of the planetary mechanisms in the Antikythera Mechanism by allowing for calibration and maintenance. The ability to disassemble and calibrate each superior planet individually ensured that the gears could be set to the correct phase for each planet on specific dates. This calibration process, although limited by the gear tooth accuracy, was crucial for aligning the output gears correctly to reflect the planetary order of the pointers. The design also accommodated the coaxial outputs on the Zodiac Dial, enabling the accurate prediction of celestial phenomena despite the inherent inaccuracies of the era. The inclusion of spacer rings, concentric tubes, and precise measurements in the assembly contributed to the mechanical accuracy and functionality of the planetary mechanisms within the Antikythera Mechanism. Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones. 2012. The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers, 4.","The design and assembly of the planet module, including the superior planet mechanisms, the Superior Planet Plate (SPP), and the Front Sub-Plate, in the Antikythera Mechanism contributed to the overall functionality and accuracy of the planetary mechanisms by providing a logical framework for the inclusion of the superior planets, which are not restricted to a fixed number of degrees from the Sun. According to Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones in ""The Cosmos in the Antikythera Mechanism,"" the superior planet mechanisms were attached to the back of the SPP, and the fixed gears for the superior planets were attached to the Front Sub-Plate in size order. This arrangement allowed the Sub-Plate to be inserted into the Mechanism properly and held the static gears in the superior planetary mechanisms sufficiently firmly. The authors' model also explains the existence of bearings and fittings on the Main Drive Wheel, b1, as well as the mysterious pillars attached to its circumference.",7
10,What is the main focus of the article regarding the Pillars of Hercules?,"The main focus of the article regarding the Pillars of Hercules is on a Syriac fragment from ""The Cause of All Causes"" that describes the Pillars of Hercules as being three in number, which is unique compared to the usual understanding of them being two.

12,Who were some of the prominent Syriac scholars who incorporated Greek knowledge into their works?,"Some of the prominent Syriac scholars who incorporated Greek knowledge into their works include Sergius of Reshaina, Jacob of Edessa, and Gregory bar ‘Ebrāyā (Barhebraeus). They translated and integrated Greek wisdom on natural philosophy into their writings, contributing to the development of Syriac scholarship in these fields. A. McCollum. (2012). “A Syriac Fragment from ‘The Cause of All Causes’ on the Pillars of Hercules.” ISAW Papers 5.","Two prominent Syriac scholars who incorporated Greek knowledge into their works were Sergius of Reš ʿAinā and Jacob of Edessa. Sergius of Reš ʿAinā (d. 536) translated parts of the pseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo, which served as a handbook for Syriac readers interested in Greek wisdom on the natural world. Jacob of Edessa (c. 630-708) incorporated Greek knowledge on the natural world into his Hexaemeron commentary. These details are mentioned in the ISAW Paper by A. McCollum titled ""A Syriac Fragment from ‘The Cause of All Causes on the Pillars of Hercules"".",9
13,What is the significance of the Syriac fragment from 'The Cause of All Causes' in relation to Syriac interest in Greek philosophy?,"The Syriac fragment from 'The Cause of All Causes' is significant because it describes the Pillars of Hercules, a topic of geographical knowledge in ancient Greek philosophy. This shows how Syriac scholars incorporated Greek wisdom and natural philosophy into their own language and culture. The fragment highlights the translation and adaptation of Greek knowledge into Syriac texts, reflecting the broader interest of Syriac scholars in Greek philosophy and natural world studies. A. McCollum.

15,How does the Syriac text describe the Pillars of Hercules and the island of Gadeira?,"The Syriac text describes the Pillars of Hercules as being three in number, rather than the commonly known two. It mentions an island called Gadeira where Hercules, referred to as a hero and prophet of the pagans, set up these three famous columns to ensure his memory would be remembered for generations. The text also describes the location of the columns at the border of the inhabited world, where ships would be unable to return if they were propelled there by the force of the winds. A. McCollum.

19,"How did the urbanization of Delos expand during the period of the second Athenian dominion, and what were the key moments in the history of Delos relevant to the discussion of urban growth on the island?","During the period of the second Athenian dominion, the urbanization of Delos expanded significantly. The urbanization expanded from the area of the old sanctuary center outwards, with new markets, agoras, port facilities, storage facilities, and residential neighborhoods developing around the sanctuary center. The residential neighborhoods were mixed, with residences, manufacturing activities, shops, and storage facilities, along with cultural activity areas like gymnasia.

Key moments in the history of Delos relevant to the discussion of urban growth on the island include:
1. The first Athenian dominion, which saw the creation of a maritime confederacy with Delos as its seat.
2. The period of independence, when Delos gained its independence and became a commercial center of the Cyclades.
3. The second Athenian dominion, during which the urbanization of Delos expanded rapidly, turning it into a boomtown.
4. The decision of the Roman Senate to make Delos a ""duty-free"" port in 167 BCE, which significantly impacted the commercial and urban development of the island. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013). The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization (fieldwork seasons 2009-2010). ISAW Papers, 6.","During the second Athenian dominion, the urbanization of Delos expanded from the area of the old sanctuary center outwards. New markets such as the Agora of the Hermaistai or the Competaliastai, the Agora of Theophrastos, and the Agora of the Delians were established at the borders of the sanctuary. The main port facilities expanded to the south and large storage facilities and shopping malls were created next to them. Residential neighborhoods developed around the sanctuary center and where good natural ports were created to complement the activities of the main port. The character of the neighborhoods was mixed with residences mingling with manufacturing activities, shops, storage facilities, and cultural activity loci such as the gymnasia (Zarmakoupi, 2013). The key moments in the history of Delos relevant to the discussion of urban growth on the island are the first Athenian dominion, the period of independence, and the second Athenian dominion (Zarmakoupi, 2013).",9
20,"How did the decision of the Roman Senate to make Delos a duty-free port in 167 BCE impact the commercial importance of the island, and what were the characteristics of the Quartier du Stade on Delos, including the structures located in this neighborhood?","The decision of the Roman Senate to make Delos a duty-free port in 167 BCE significantly impacted the commercial importance of the island. This decision prohibited the Athenians from levying import and export duties on trade passing through the harbor, attracting merchants and traders from various regions. Delos became a hub for trade between the East and the West, leading to a rapid economic development and demographic growth on the island.

The Quartier du Stade on Delos was a newly-formed neighborhood after 167 BCE, characterized by rapid urbanization and redevelopment. This neighborhood saw the construction of new houses, docksides, warehouses, and markets to accommodate the growing commercial activities on the island. The structures in this neighborhood, such as Houses IC and ID, were built reactively to fit the needs of the inhabitants and their commercial activities. The construction techniques, like mud brick walls, suggest that changes were implemented quickly without prior planning. The Quartier du Stade exemplifies the forces that shaped the city of Delos in this period, including economy, politics, and ideology. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013). The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization (fieldwork seasons 2009-2010). ISAW Papers, 6.","The decision of the Roman Senate to make Delos a duty-free port in 167 BCE led to a significant increase in the island's commercial importance. The island became an intermediary in Rome's commercial relations with the Hellenistic east, leading to rapid urbanization and unprecedented demographic growth. This is evidenced by the formation of new neighborhoods and massive constructions of docksides, warehouses, and markets (Zarmakoupi, 2013). One of the newly-formed neighborhoods during this period was the Quartier du Stade. This neighborhood was characterized by smaller port facilities that accommodated smaller boats and traded lighter goods such as perfumes, unguents, incense, gems, and dyes. Manufacturing facilities for dye and perfume have been identified in this neighborhood. The neighborhood also had storage facilities that responded to the needs of the commercial activities of Delos (Zarmakoupi, 2013).",9
21,"How did the architectural changes in Houses IC and ID on Delos reflect the integration of commercial needs into the domestic sphere, and what evidence suggests that the inhabitants of House ID may have used some rooms for commercial activities or rentals?","The architectural changes in Houses IC and ID on Delos reflected the integration of commercial needs into the domestic sphere by creating spaces that could operate independently as workshops, businesses, storage places, or sleeping rooms, and potentially be rented out for such functions. The modifications included breaking down larger rooms into smaller ones or adding extra small rooms to accommodate commercial activities. In House ID, evidence suggests that some rooms were used for commercial activities or rentals, as certain rooms were grouped together and accessible through one entrance, potentially operating independently from the rest of the house. These rooms could have served as stores, workshops, or spaces for other commercial activities, indicating a blend of domestic and commercial functions within the household. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013).

Owners made the most of the available space by adding small rooms outside the original plan of the houses, taking over part of the street, to create spaces for service, storage, and workshops. Evidence suggesting that the inhabitants of House ID may have used some rooms for commercial activities or rentals includes the modifications conducted at a later phase in House ID, which created groups of rooms that could operate independently as workshops, businesses, storage places, or sleeping rooms, and presumably could be rented out for such functions (M. Zarmakoupi, 2013).",10
22,"How did the modifications in Houses IC and ID on Delos compare to changes made in other houses in the Quartier de Skardhana, such as the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens, in relation to the economic and social dynamics of the late Hellenistic period?","The modifications in Houses IC and ID on Delos, as well as in other houses like the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens in the Quartier de Skardhana, were made to create spaces that integrated commercial needs within the domestic sphere. Owners aimed to make profit without altering the spacious layout of the ground floor of their houses. These modifications included adding small rooms for service, storage, workshops, and even renting out spaces. The changes were reactive to the economic dynamics of late Hellenistic Delos, where individual needs shaped the available space within the houses to accommodate commercial activities. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013). The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization (fieldwork seasons 2009-2010). ISAW Papers, 6.","The modifications in Houses IC and ID on Delos, as described by M. Zarmakoupi in ""The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization,"" were similar to changes made in other houses in the Quartier de Skardhana, such as the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens. These changes were driven by the need to integrate commercial activities within the domestic sphere due to the dynamic economic microclimate of late Hellenistic Delos. In both cases, owners created new spatial arrangements to maximize the use of available space and to accommodate their commercial needs. This included the addition of small rooms outside the original plan of the houses, which were used for service, storage, and workshops. However, while the owners of the Maison des Tritons and the Maison des Comédiens sought to profit from their properties without altering the spacious layout of their houses, the owners of Houses IC and ID also changed the layout of their houses, such as breaking down larger rooms to form smaller ones.",8
23,"What does the archaeological evidence from Delos suggest about the diversity of economic activities and uses within residential neighborhoods during the late Hellenistic period, and how did the rapid urbanization of Delos impact the demographic growth and cultural diversity of the island's population?","The archaeological evidence from Delos suggests that there was a diversity of economic activities within residential neighborhoods during the late Hellenistic period. The island experienced rapid urbanization, leading to significant demographic growth and cultural diversity in its population. The influx of traders and dealers from various regions, including Greece, Macedonia, the Hellenistic East, and Rome, contributed to the cosmopolitan character of the island. The urbanization expanded from the old sanctuary center outwards, creating new neighborhoods like the Quartier du Stade. This growth was fueled by economic development, political changes, and the unprecedented demographic increase on the island. The architecture of the houses in these neighborhoods reflected a mix of local building techniques with distinct religious and ethnic influences, showcasing a unique architectural koine. The urbanization of Delos during this period can be compared to boomtowns, with a sudden surge in population and economic activities. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013). The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization (fieldwork seasons 2009-2010). ISAW Papers, 6.","Archaeological evidence from Delos suggests a variety of economic activities within residential neighborhoods during the late Hellenistic period, including the production of perfume, purple dye, glass jewelry, sculpture, and terracotta figurines (Zarmakoupi, 2013). The rapid urbanization of Delos, which occurred between 167 BCE and the sacks of 88 and 69 BCE, resulted in significant demographic growth and cultural diversity. The island's population increased from about 1,500 to 2,000 during the period of independence to an estimated 15,000 during the period of the second Athenian dominion. The new residents were primarily from the eastern Mediterranean and the Italian peninsula, with some coming from as far away as south Yemen, contributing to the island's cosmopolitan character (Zarmakoupi, 2013).",10
24,"In what ways did the architectural layout and design of houses in the Quartier du Stade on Delos reflect the economic and social dynamics of the late Hellenistic period, and how were private initiatives and public benefactions involved in shaping the city of Delos during this time?","The architectural layout and design of houses in the Quartier du Stade on Delos reflected the economic and social dynamics of the late Hellenistic period by accommodating and complementing the commercial activities of the port. The smaller capacity of these houses catered to a different kind of commerce than that of the main port, focusing on goods like perfumes, unguents, incense, gems, and dyes. The smaller storage facilities integrated within the residences and next to manufacturing installations responded to the needs of the commercial activities of Delos and were closely related to the activities of the ports.

Private initiatives and public benefactions played a significant role in shaping the city of Delos during this time. Private initiatives financed public constructions that shaped the city, while public benefactions ignited development in the city. The hastiness in construction, as seen in the use of mud brick walls, suggests that changes were implemented reactively to fit the needs of the inhabitants and their commercial activities, rather than being planned in advance. This combination of private and public influences contributed to the rapid urbanization and development of Delos during the late Hellenistic period. Mantha Zarmakoupi (2013). The Quartier du Stade on late Hellenistic Delos: a case study of rapid urbanization (fieldwork seasons 2009-2010). ISAW Papers, 6.","The architectural layout and design of houses in the Quartier du Stade on Delos reflected the economic and social dynamics of the late Hellenistic period in several ways. The provision for storage within the neighborhood was closely tied to the commercial activities of Delos, suggesting that the houses were designed to accommodate and complement these activities. The development of the area was driven by two main forces: the need for spaces that could support the commercial activities of the port, and private initiatives that financed public constructions. These private initiatives, along with public benefactions, played a significant role in shaping the city of Delos. Benefactions were a means of self-representation and promotion and contributed to the development of the sanctuary and city of Delos from early on. These benefactions must be understood in the context of competing claims over the growing importance of the international commerce of Delos (M. Zarmakoupi, 2013).",9

37,Why is stability of published URIs emphasized in the context of Linked Open Data?,"The stability of published URIs is emphasized in the context of Linked Open Data because it ensures that the digital resources remain accessible and usable over time. By maintaining stable URIs, users can rely on the links to access specific information consistently, even as the web evolves. This practice is crucial for preserving the integrity and reliability of data shared through Linked Open Data principles.  2014,""Prologue and Introduction"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.1, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-heath-muccigrosso/.","Stability of published URIs is emphasized in the context of Linked Open Data because it ensures that the resources remain accessible and reliable over time. This is particularly important for projects that publish individual URIs for all discrete resources, as endorsed at LAWDI (Elliott, Heath, and Muccigrosso, ISAW Papers 7.1). Stable URIs also facilitate the use of common vocabularies and machine readability, which are key for linking and harvesting data across different resources (Elliott, Heath, and Muccigrosso, ISAW Papers 7.1). Furthermore, the use of stable URIs in content management systems can significantly impact digital scholarship (McMichael, ISAW Papers 7.14).",10
38,"What is a ""RDF Triple"" and how is it used in the context of sharing digital resources?","A triple is a statement of information in three parts: the subject, the predicate, and the object. In the context of sharing digital resources, RDF Triples are used to represent data in a machine-readable format using URIs for each element of the triple. This allows for the information to be linked and easily consumed by both humans and automated systems. RDF Triples play a crucial role in Linked Open Data (LOD) by providing a common format for representing diverse concepts published on the public internet, enabling greater compatibility between resources and facilitating data linking and analysis by third parties.  2014,""Prologue and Introduction"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.1, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-heath-muccigrosso/.","An RDF Triple, part of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), is a statement of information in three parts: a subject, a predicate, and an object. The subject is the resource being described, the predicate describes the relationship, and the object is what the subject is referencing (Applying Linked Open Data Standards, Ryan Horne, ISAW Papers 20.2). This format is used to represent information about web resources and is a fundamental concept in the publication of reusable data on the public internet (Prologue and Introduction, Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath and John Muccigrosso, ISAW Papers 7.1). In the context of sharing digital resources, RDF triples are used to encourage interoperability and are particularly efficient for serving, querying, and sharing archival material in an RDF triplestore (The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration, Christopher W. Blackwell and D. Neel Smith, ISAW Papers 7.5). The use of RDF triples is leading to greater compatibility between resources that generate them (Prologue and Introduction, Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath and John Muccigrosso, ISAW Papers 7.1).",10

47,What is the main goal of the Perseus Digital Library in terms of making its data available?,"The main goal of the Perseus Digital Library is to make all of its data available according to the best practices outlined by Heath and Bizer (2011) and to ensure that the URIs are stable and properly dereferenceable. They are working towards publishing stable URIs for various resources in the library and altering the representation of resource content to advertise its linkable features via RDF-A.  2014,""Linked Data in the Perseus Digital Library"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.3, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/almas-babeu-krohn/.","The main goal of the Perseus Digital Library, as outlined by Bridget Almas, Alison Babeu, and Anna Krohn in ""Linked Data in the Perseus Digital Library"" (ISAW Papers 7.3, 2014), is to make all of its data available according to the best practices of linked data. This involves careful consideration of the URIs used to name and address the Perseus texts, catalog metadata, and other data objects, ensuring these URIs are stable and properly dereferenceable. The library is also working towards full compliance with linked data best practices and plans to make its authority record data for classical authors available to the Virtual International Authority File.",10
48,"How are URIs structured in the Perseus Digital Library, and what is the significance of defining these URIs?","URIs in the Perseus Digital Library are structured under the http://data.perseus.org URI prefix, followed by path components indicating the resource type and a unique identifier for the resource. The significance of defining these URIs lies in ensuring stability, proper dereferenceability, and adherence to Linked Data standards. By defining these URIs, the Perseus Digital Library can make its data linkable and discoverable, enhancing accessibility and interoperability within the digital classics community.  2014,""Linked Data in the Perseus Digital Library"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.3, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/almas-babeu-krohn/.","In the Perseus Digital Library, URIs are structured with a prefix (http://data.perseus.org), followed by one or more path components indicating the resource type, and then a unique identifier for the resources, with an optional path component identifying a specific output format for the resource (Almas, Babeu, and Krohn, ISAW Papers 7.3). The library has released URIs for texts, citations, and bibliographic catalog records. The significance of defining these URIs is to ensure their stability and proper dereferencing, which is crucial for the library's goal of making all of its data available according to best practices. This approach also allows the library to publish URIs incrementally, given the large volume of resources and limited manpower, which benefits both their work and their community of users.",10
49,"What types of resources currently have published URIs in the Perseus Digital Library, and what formats are supported for citations and texts?","In the Perseus Digital Library, currently published URIs are available for texts, citations, and bibliographic catalog records.

The currently supported data formats for citations are HTML and XML, while for full text URIs, HTML is the only currently supported format, but XML will be available soon (Almas, Babeu, and Krohn, ISAW Papers 7.3, 2014).",10
50,How does the Perseus Digital Library combine Canonical Text Services (CTS) URNs with URI standards to create meaningful URIs for texts and citations?,"The Perseus Digital Library combines Canonical Text Services (CTS) URNs with URI standards by using semantically meaningful URIs for texts and citations. They create URIs that identify specific resources by appending identifiers to the CTS URNs. For example, they use URNs to specify the notional work, such as Homer's Iliad, and then add an edition identifier to specify the unique resource in the Perseus CTS inventory. By prefixing these URNs with the http://data.perseus.org URI prefix and path components, they create stable URIs that can be resolved to access the desired resources. This approach allows for precise identification and retrieval of texts and citations within the Perseus Digital Library.  2014,""Linked Data in the Perseus Digital Library"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.3, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/almas-babeu-krohn/.","The Perseus Digital Library combines Canonical Text Services (CTS) URNs with URI standards to create semantically meaningful URIs for texts and citations. This is achieved by publishing all Perseus data URIs under the http://data.perseus.org URI prefix, followed by one or more path components indicating the resource type, then a unique identifier for the resources, and an optional path component identifying a specific output format for the resource. The Perseus stable URIs for citations and texts leverage CTS URNs, enabling the library to take advantage of the CTS data model while still supporting Linked Data standards. Individual passage citations can be retrieved at URIs which adhere to a specific syntax (Almas, Babeu, and Krohn, ISAW Papers 7.3 (2014)).",10
51,How are catalog records distinguished from texts in terms of URIs in the Perseus Digital Library?,"Catalog records in the Perseus Digital Library are distinguished from texts in terms of URIs by including the 'catalog' path element in the URI.

66,How has the integration of RDF triples benefited the Homer Multitext project?,"The integration of RDF triples has benefited the Homer Multitext project by providing a means of linking between projects, capturing and integrating the project's data for internal use, and enabling efficient management of the large, diverse, and evolving body of data generated by the project. RDF triples have allowed for a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to manage scholarly activities, archival data formats, and presentation formats. Additionally, RDF triples have facilitated the publication, serving, querying, and sharing of data, making it more efficient and broadly useful. The use of RDF has also enabled the project to avoid complex processing and clever solutions, leading to a more straightforward and forward-looking approach to data management.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","The integration of RDF triples into the Homer Multitext project has significantly improved the management and integration of the project's diverse and evolving body of data, according to Christopher W. Blackwell and D. Neel Smith in their paper ""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"". The simplicity and flexibility of RDF, along with its freely available tools and widespread support, have allowed the project to effectively handle data from a wide range of contributors, from first-year Greek students to tenured professors at major universities. The use of RDF has also facilitated the creation of a test-driven environment for a publication cycle of edit, test, integrate, compile, serve, and format. Furthermore, the use of RDF triples has enabled the efficient serving, querying, and sharing of archival material through an RDF triplestore.",10
67,Why is separation of concerns important in integrating a large body of data in the project?,"Separation of concerns is important in integrating a large body of data in the project because it allows for a clean and organized division of different scholarly activities. By separating activities cleanly and associating each with an appropriate archival data format, such as TEI-XML for editing texts, tabular formats for analysis, and RDF triples for serving and sharing data, the project can efficiently manage the diverse and evolving data generated by a widely distributed group of scholars. This approach ensures that each aspect of the project can be handled independently, leading to better organization, easier maintenance, and improved collaboration among scholars at different stages of their careers.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","Separation of concerns is important in integrating a large body of data in a project because it allows for the management of a diverse and evolving dataset, which may be under development by a widely distributed group of scholars at various stages of their careers. This approach ensures that each aspect of the project is handled independently, allowing for more efficient and effective data integration. This is particularly important when dealing with complex projects that involve multiple contributors and different types of data (Blackwell and Smith, ISAW Papers 7.5, 2014).",10
68,"How is a ""text"" defined in the context of the project, and how does the OHCO2 model play a role in this definition?","In the context of the project, a ""text"" is defined as an ""ordered hierarchy of citation objects."" This definition follows the OHCO2 model, which prioritizes units of citation over any other hierarchy. The OHCO2 model ensures the most important scholarly activity, which is citation and retrieval. This model allows for accommodating any other content elements or orthogonal views of a text to a greater or lesser degree of granularity, depending on editorial decisions about citation.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","A ""text"" in the context of the project is defined as a work that has been assigned identifiers for its work-group, work, and version, and has a unique identifier for each of its parts, which may or may not be in a hierarchy. The contents of these parts are not expected to change, making the text canonically citable (Koentges et al., ISAW Papers 20.8). The OHCO2 model is implemented in the CITE architecture through the Canonical Text Services protocol, which defines a structure for a catalog, a small number of valid requests for discovery and retrieval, and the format of responses to those requests (Blackwell and Smith, ISAW Papers 7.5).",7
69,"What tools and formats are used for editing, building, integrating, and publishing data in the project?","The tools and formats used for editing, building, integrating, and publishing data in the Homer Multitext project are as follows:

1. **Editing:**
   - Texts: TEI-XML format edited using tools like Oxygen.
   - Collections: Plain text, comma- or tab-delimited format edited using tools like Google Fusion Tables, Git Online Editor, etc.
   - Validation: TEI-XML files validated using RelaxNG Schema.

2. **Building & Integrating:**
   - Testing Validity of Texts: Flattened, tabular data format.
   - Integrating Texts, Data, and Images: RDF triples.
   - Tools: Gradle build-system and custom scripts.

3. **Publishing:**
   - Serving Data: RDF triples using Fuseki SPARQL endpoint.
   - Discovery, Query, Retrieval: RDF triples converted to XML using CITE Servlet.
   - End-user display: Citations converted to XML Fragments and then to HTML using CITEKit.

These tools and formats are used to manage the workflow and architecture of the Homer Multitext project efficiently.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","The Syriaca.org project uses TEI XML as the native data format for authoring data, which is then serialized into RDF and HTML to enrich its knowledge graph (David A. Michelson, ISAW Papers 20.10, 2021). The Beta mau1e63u0101u1e25u01ddft project also encodes data in TEI, following the model set by Syriaca.org (Liuzzo, ISAW Papers 20.7, 2021). For the CITE Architecture project, data is serialized in the CEX format and edited using UNIX utilities and applications such as cat, tab, nl, vim (Thomas Koentges et al., ISAW Papers 20.8, 2021). The British Museum's ResearchSpace project converts the Museum's collections catalogue into RDF triples, mapped to the CIDOC-CRM ontology (ISAW Papers 7.28, 2014). For serving, querying, and sharing archival material, an RDF triplestore is used, while XML, XSLT, and CSS are used for data presentation (Christopher W. Blackwell and D. Neel Smith, ISAW Papers 7.5, 2014).",1
70,How does the project validate and test its data at build-time?,"The project uses Gradle to build its .ttl file, compiling XML texts, collections, and indices saved as .csv or .tsv files. The build-scripts perform validation on XML files and other domain-specific tests. Additionally, the project has a system called HMT-MOM (Mandatory Ongoing Maintenance) that enforces a canon of legitimate Unicode characters for Greek texts, ensures referential integrity of URN values in indices and CITE Collection data structures, and supports manual review by providing visualizations of the state of completion for each folio edited by collaborators. HMT-MOM also conducts linguistic checking by matching each word-token against the Morpheus morphological parser. Words that fail to match are identified as non-standard forms present on a manuscript, non-lexical strings, or new Greek vocabulary to be added to a new lexicon of the language.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.",The context does not provide specific information on how a project validates and tests its data at build-time.,1
71,How does the project use inferencing and RDF to capture relationships between data objects?,"The project uses RDF (Resource Description Framework) to capture relationships between data objects by representing the data as RDF triples. These triples consist of subject-predicate-object statements that describe the relationships between different entities in the data. By using RDF, the project can explicitly define and store relationships between objects, such as texts, collections, and images, in a structured and machine-readable format. This allows for efficient querying, retrieval, and integration of data objects based on their relationships, enabling the project to manage and work with a large, diverse, and evolving body of data effectively.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","The project uses RDF (Resource Description Framework) to model data in terms of relationships between entities, properties, and classes. This is done by forming statements that consist of three parts: entity A has a relation or property B with entity or predicate C, where A, B, and C are explicitly referenced by identifiers (Gabriel Bodard, ISAW Papers 20.4, 2021). This structure allows for the capture of relationships between data objects. The project also uses inferencing to establish, leverage, and build upon existing relationships between cultural heritage data, which is essential for building context and connection between scholarly datasets (Hannah Scates Kettler, ISAW Papers 20.5, 2021).",10
72,What challenges are faced in terms of efficiency and scalability in the current implementation of the project?,"The challenges faced in terms of efficiency and scalability in the current implementation of the project include inefficiency in the middle layers between the CITE Service and the SPARQL endpoint. It takes 10 SPARQL queries to retrieve and re-assemble one citation-node of a text, which may not scale well when the SPARQL server is hosting millions of statements. This inefficiency could require a more efficient solution that works directly with URNs at query time or a client that connects to a SPARQL endpoint using web sockets to address the I/O bottleneck. The value of having cleanly separated concerns—data, integration, storage, services, applications—will become more apparent as the project scales.  2014,""The Homer Multitext and RDF-Based Integration"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.5, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/blackwell-smith/.","The current implementation of the project faces challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability due to the diversity of data sources and formats. As Chen and Folsom explain in ""Origins and Antidotes of Omission: Southeastern European Archaeology, Linked Open Data, and the Possibilities for Archaeological Integration,"" datasets are composed in different languages, conceived at different times, and defined by distinct organizational apparatuses. This diversity presents a technical barrier to interoperation between projects. Additionally, the process of exporting raw data to a common format to be shared across projects adds work, slows collaboration, and means that changes to the source dataset render the exported copy out of date. This issue is further complicated by the fact that most archaeologists are not familiar with RDF, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, SPARQL or other Web related technologies and standards, as Kansa points out in ""Open Context and Linked Data.""",4

74,What is the mission of the library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World?,"The mission of the library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World is not only to acquire traditional paper-based scholarship but also to develop digital resources as a fundamental component of its collections. It aims to integrate the world’s oldest languages, scripts, and cultures with the newest technologies.  2014,""Moving the Ancient World Online Forward"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.6, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-jones.","The mission of the library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is to not only acquire traditional paper-based scholarship but also to develop digital resources as a fundamental component of its collections. This involves integrating the world's oldest languages, scripts, and cultures with the newest technologies. The library aims to bring a vast array of documents, databases, websites, and other digital resources within the reach of its faculty, students, and visiting scholars in an organized and useful manner, continuously updated. This is to facilitate scholarly work across many related sub-disciplines and increase discoverability of academic studies that mention specific subjects (Elliott and Jones, ISAW Papers 7.6, 2014; Acheson, ISAW Papers 7.2, 2014).",10
75,How has the library integrated digital resources into its collections?,"The library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World has integrated digital resources into its collections by developing digital resources as a fundamental component of its collections. They have partnered with the NYU Library's Digital Library Technology Services team and ISAW's own Digital Programs department to acquire, describe, catalog, and make accessible a growing global corpus of digital scholarly resources. They have also launched initiatives like AWOL (The Ancient World Online) to index and describe digital and digitized antiquity, making these resources available to a wide audience through various publication channels. Additionally, they are seeking to enhance their current processes by using tools like Zotero to capture, annotate, and synchronize web resources for publication, thereby creating new dissemination channels for a broader set of audience use cases.  2014,""Moving the Ancient World Online Forward"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.6, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-jones.","The library has integrated digital resources into its collections in several ways. For instance, the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, as described by Ellen Van Keer in ISAW Papers 7.30 (2014), are working on a cross-domain integration project to make their museum and library datasets cross searchable in a single online interface. This is a challenge due to the different sets of standards traditionally used by the museum and library sectors. Another example is the Homer Multitext project, which, as described by Christopher W. Blackwell and D. Neel Smith in ISAW Papers 7.5 (2014), has developed a digital library architecture called CITE to manage their work. They have recognized the potential of RDF triples for capturing and integrating the project's data. Furthermore, ISAW's own library, under the leadership of Charles Jones, has partnered with NYU Library's Digital Library Technology Services team and ISAW's own Digital Programs department to work on the identification, description, cataloging, and accessibility of the growing global corpus of digital scholarly resources (ISAW Papers 7.6, 2014).",4

The article discusses the tension with traditional library practices due to much of the material appearing on the open web, outside established library acquisition and cataloging channels. The need for an easy way to capture and describe digital resources anywhere on the open web that integrates smoothly with existing and emerging library systems, standard scholarly research management software, and public-facing websites is highlighted as a concern.  2014,""Moving the Ancient World Online Forward"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.6, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-jones.","The key concerns regarding the accessibility of digital scholarly resources mentioned in the articles include the lack of integration among different digital resources and databases, which requires researchers to perform individual searches on each platform and manually assemble results (Bagnall and Heath 2018). Language is also a limiting factor in the knowledge of available digital resources. Furthermore, the conversion of analog data into a digital format and making it available online does not necessarily make it widely discoverable or useful for sharing across projects (Hunnell Chen and Folsom, ISAW Papers 20.12, 2021). There is also the challenge of handling an overabundance of digital information (David A. Michelson, ISAW Papers 20.10, 2021). Lastly, there are issues with important datasets existing in difficult to access, proprietary, and closed digital formats, particularly in parts of the world that have been historically marginalized (Hunnell Chen and Folsom, ISAW Papers 20.12, 2021).",4
77,How did Jones support the goal of making digital and digitized antiquity accessible through AWOL?,"Jones supported the goal of making digital and digitized antiquity accessible through AWOL by launching AWOL in 2009 as an extension to Abzu, a guide to networked open access data relevant to the study and public presentation of the Ancient Near East and the Ancient Mediterranean world. AWOL has become the primary source of information on digital and digitized antiquity, indexing and describing scholarly resources, open access serial publications, born digital projects, and repositories of digitized scholarship related to antiquity. It reaches its audience through a blog, email syndication, and social media outlets, making the information immediately available to a wide audience. Additionally, Jones proposed enhancements to AWOL to maintain core delivery mechanisms while adding additional publication channels and streamlining content capture and preparation through automation and structured databases.  2014,""Moving the Ancient World Online Forward"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.6, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/elliott-jones.","Jones supported the goal of making digital and digitized antiquity accessible through AWOL by identifying relevant web content and manually copying it into the AWOL blog, which is hosted by Google's Blogger service. He edited the content as necessary and then published it, making it immediately available to AWOL's blog audience over the World-Wide Web. Blogger then pushed summary information about each publishing update to Google's Feedburner service, which automatically published both an update feed and a daily email digest.

Ryan Horne 2014,""Beyond Maps as Images at the Ancient World Mapping Center"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.9, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/horne/.","The Ancient World Mapping Center (AWMC) initially viewed maps as flat images, but during the production of a series of wall maps, the limitations of this approach became apparent. The scale of the project and the numerous changes suggested by reviewers highlighted the need for a system that was easily reproducible, searchable, and scalable to display and sort the over 200,000 individual objects in the center's database. As a result, the AWMC initiated a project to create a customizable web application to generate maps and replace the older static images. The first result of these efforts was the Antiquity À-la-carte application, launched in March 2012 (Horne, ISAW Papers 7.9, 2014).",10
107,How did the AWMC align its resources with the Pleiades project and incorporate linked data principles into its database?,"The AWMC aligned its resources with the Pleiades project by associating geographic items with Pleiades IDs and creating a database-driven interface. They modified their data to adhere to URI best practices and 5-star principles outlined by Tim Berners-Lee, ensuring permanence, simplicity, and agnostic naming schemes. They created a PostGIS database to house and display Pleiades data, added appropriate metadata to Shapefiles, and imported completed Shapefiles into the database. Additionally, they created an API interface to their database using RESTful URIs and joined the Pelagios Project, making it easy to create RDF files and link to the Pelagios system.

Initially, a PostGIS database was created to house and display Pleiades data. This was followed by the use of GIS software to identify and add appropriate metadata to the Shapefiles produced by the center, a task largely done by hand. These completed Shapefiles were then imported into the PostGIS database. In January 2013, the AWMC created an API interface to its database using RESTful URIs and joined the Pelagios Project. All features for AWMC maps were first associated with appropriate Pleiades IDs through name and location matching in the AWMC database, with the results then added to the API. This allowed the AWMC to easily deploy the à-la-carte framework to quickly produce new web applications and provide resources to Pleiades, Pelagios, and any other projects which use Pleiades IDs (Horne, ISAW Papers 7.9, 2014).",9

112,"What challenges do archaeologists face in data sharing, especially with the increasing use of digital technologies?","Archaeologists face challenges in data sharing due to the increasing reliance on digital technologies. They collect more digital documentation than can be feasibly shared in print, leading to issues of quantity. Additionally, organizing data into structures like tables or relational databases for analysis requires new venues to access and share structured data. There is a need for preservation of the archaeological record through data accessioning into repositories, as well as a growing recognition of data sharing as good professional practice for independent reinterpretation of past narratives. The need for rich documentation, alignment to standards, and vocabularies used by other data sources poses challenges in data sharing and integration across multiple projects. Archaeologists may lack familiarity with technologies like RDF, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies, necessitating collaboration with informatics specialists for effective data dissemination. Eric C.

According to Eric C. Kansa in ""Open Context and Linked Data,"" the sheer quantity of digital documentation collected now surpasses what can feasibly and cost-effectively be shared in print. Additionally, the structuring of data into tables or relational databases for analysis and visualization requires new venues for access and sharing. The integration of data from multiple projects for reuse presents another challenge, as it requires significant effort and specialized skills and expertise, such as familiarity with RDF, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, SPARQL, and other web-related technologies and standards. Furthermore, there are challenges in bringing data from historically marginalized parts of the world into international research conversations, due to a lack of awareness of Linked Open Data standards and practices, or a lack of manpower to devote to the problem (Hunnell Chen and Folsom, ""Origins and Antidotes of Omission: Southeastern European Archaeology, Linked Open Data, and the Possibilities for Archaeological Integration"").",10
113,How does data sharing in archaeology differ from traditional dissemination strategies like monographs and site reports?,"Data sharing in archaeology differs from traditional dissemination strategies like monographs and site reports in that it involves sharing structured data in formats that can be easily loaded into data management software for querying, visualizing, and analyzing. Archaeologists now collect more digital documentation than can be feasibly shared in print, and they organize data into structures like tables or relational databases. This shift to digital data sharing is driven by the need for preservation, accessibility, and the ability to integrate data from multiple projects.

114,"Why is it important for archaeologists to preserve and share structured data, and what are the implications of not doing so?","It is important for archaeologists to preserve and share structured data because it allows for the documentation of the archaeological record, making data available for independent reinterpretation and ensuring that interpretations and narratives of the past are based on accessible evidence. Failure to preserve and share structured data can lead to a loss of valuable information, hindering future research, and making it difficult to compare datasets or integrate data from multiple projects. Additionally, not sharing structured data can limit transparency and reproducibility in archaeological research, impacting the credibility and reliability of archaeological findings. Eric C. Kansa 2014,""Open Context and Linked Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.10, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/kansa.","Archaeologists need to preserve and share structured data for several reasons. According to Eric C. Kansa in ""Open Context and Linked Data"", the sheer quantity of digital documentation now collected by archaeologists is far more than can be feasibly shared in print. Therefore, data sharing usually means sharing structured data in formats that can be easily loaded into data management software, queried, visualized and analyzed. Furthermore, to be understood and useful in the future, and to be comparable to other datasets, datasets usually need rich documentation and alignment to standards and vocabularies used by other data sources. If this is not done, important datasets may exist in difficult to access, proprietary, and closed digital formats, or they may be marginalized and not participate in important international conversations about the future of research in archaeology, as mentioned by Hunnell Chen and Folsom in ""Origins and Antidotes of Omission: Southeastern European Archaeology, Linked Open Data, and the Possibilities for Archaeological Integration"".",9
115,"How does Open Context approach the publication of archaeological data, and what role does Linked Data play in this process?","Open Context approaches the publication of archaeological data by using a ""data sharing as publication"" model. This model involves providing data editing and annotation services to improve the quality of the data shared by researchers. Open Context also participates in the world of Linked Open Data to make data more usable and of higher quality. Linked Open Data is a distributed approach to publishing data on the web that promotes interoperability and integration of structured data. Open Context contributes to Linked Open Data by minting unique web identifiers for individual items described in the data and by referencing Linked Data published by other expert communities, such as the Pleiades gazetteer and the British Museum's controlled vocabulary. Additionally, Open Context experiments with mapping data to the CIDOC-CRM, a shared schema for organizing data, to align with widely accepted standards in the field of archaeology. Eric C. Kansa 2014,""Open Context and Linked Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.10, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/kansa.","Open Context approaches the publication of archaeological data by situating data dissemination in professional practice, with a focus on making data easier to understand and use. This is particularly relevant given the increasing interest in the management, preservation, and sharing of structured data, as well as the growing recognition among archaeologists of the need to preserve and share data as part of good professional practice (Eric C. Kansa, ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014). Linked Data plays a key role in this process, as it allows for the annotation of data to facilitate citation, search, browse, and retrieval features. However, the highly specialized nature of archaeological data can make it challenging to build a critical mass of relevant data that would benefit from integration and comparative analysis (Open Context and Linked Data).",7
116,What are some of the challenges and benefits of aligning archaeological data with the CIDOC-CRM ontology?,"Some of the challenges of aligning archaeological data with the CIDOC-CRM ontology include the complexity of the ontology, making it difficult to use in practice. The CIDOC-CRM contains many conceptual nuances that can lead to different potential mappings, requiring interpretive decisions that may not always be straightforward. Additionally, there is a lack of real-world examples of CIDOC-CRM organized datasets in archaeology, making it hard to find guidance on how to effectively align data.

On the other hand, the benefits of aligning archaeological data with the CIDOC-CRM ontology include the potential for powerful inference capabilities by drawing upon logical relationships between data and ontologies. It can also help in standardizing data organization, making it easier to integrate and compare datasets across different projects. However, these benefits are more aspirational at this stage, and the practical challenges of using the CIDOC-CRM ontology in archaeological data management are significant. Eric C. Kansa 2014,""Open Context and Linked Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.10, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/kansa.","The CIDOC-CRM ontology is a sophisticated tool for organizing archaeological data, but its complexity can make it difficult to use in practice (Kansa, ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014). Despite its prominence and adoption as an ISO standard, there are few real-world examples of CIDOC-CRM organized datasets, particularly in archaeology, which makes it hard to find guidance for its implementation (Kansa, ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014). However, the CIDOC-CRM is seen as a natural choice for the publication of archaeological data according to widely accepted standards, particularly in the European Union (Kansa, ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014).",8

The process involves editorial practices that cross-reference Open Context data with vocabularies like EOL, UBERON and Pleiades. Open Context contributes to the larger body of Linked Open Data resources in two main ways. First, it creates a unique and stable Web identifier for every individual item described in the data, which removes ambiguity about the item being referenced. Second, it references Linked Data published by other expert communities, such as the Pleiades gazetteer, which helps remove ambiguity about ancient places that may be referenced in the data published by Open Context. This makes it easier to relate Open Context content with content from other sources that also reference Pleiades (Eric C. Kansa, ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014).",9

By linking different zooarchaeological datasets to common controlled vocabularies like EOL and UBERON, researchers can easily aggregate and compare data without the complexities associated with aligning datasets to elaborate semantic models. This approach focuses on practical issues of vocabulary control, making it more accessible and useful for researchers, especially those who may lack sophisticated programming skills. Eric C.

153,"What is the unique aspect of coinage as evidence for the ancient world, and how does it contribute to the understanding of the ancient economy?","The unique aspect of coinage as evidence for the ancient world is that coins are monetary objects, providing a key element in reconstructing the workings of the ancient economy. Through processes like die-study, it is possible to quantify ancient monetary production by determining how many dies were used to strike a given coinage. This allows for the estimation of the size of production, attributing coins to specific rulers or cities, and comparing the monetary output of different regions. Additionally, coins have find spots, giving insight into economic circulation, connectivity, and movement. By mapping coins from their source to deposition, it is possible to understand regional histories and compare monetary profiles of different sites. Coins also offer information about the intentions of issuers and users through their designs and inscriptions, shedding light on areas from local religion to imperial economic policy. The iconographic and epigraphic repertoire of ancient coinage provides a valuable resource for studying various aspects of ancient societies.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods.

A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"". This allows for the quantification of ancient monetary production and the comparison of monetary output across different cities, kingdoms, and empires. Additionally, coins are also archaeological objects with find spots, providing evidence for movement, connectivity, and economic circulation. This information can be used to reconstruct the workings of the ancient economy and to understand the monetary profile of the site they are excavating.",9
154,How do find spots of coins within archaeological contexts provide insight into the monetary profile of a site and regional history?,"Find spots of coins within archaeological contexts provide valuable insights into the monetary profile of a site and regional history by offering evidence of economic circulation, connectivity, and movement. By knowing where a coin was minted and where it was found, researchers can trace the trajectory of coins, revealing patterns of trade, economic relationships, and monetary interactions between different locations. This information can help in understanding the economic activities, trade networks, and monetary systems of a specific site or region, and comparing them with others to uncover regional economic histories.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods. A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.15, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meadows-gruber/.","Coins within archaeological contexts can provide valuable insights into the monetary profile of the site they are excavating and the regional history. According to Reece (1982) as cited in Gruber and Meadows' ""Numismatics and Linked Open Data"", the find spots of coins can give them a trajectory, providing evidence for movement, connectivity, and economic circulation. If the origin and find spot of a coin are known, it can be mapped from source to deposition, providing a unique perspective on the economic and historical context of the region. This can help in comparing the site with others of similar or different types and a regional history may emerge from multiple sites.",10
155,"How has the advent of the metal detector impacted the recording of individual coin finds, and what new opportunities has it opened up for research?","The advent of the metal detector has impacted the recording of individual coin finds by expanding the scope of recording beyond excavation materials. For example, the Portable Antiquities Scheme in the United Kingdom has recorded find spots for a large number of coins. This has led to new works of synthesis and has opened up opportunities for research by providing a substantial amount of data that can be used to address questions that were previously unanswerable through other source materials. The metal detector has allowed for the recording of individual coin finds outside of traditional excavation contexts, leading to a significant increase in available data for study.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods. A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.15, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meadows-gruber/.","The advent of the metal detector has significantly increased the recording of individual coin finds, as it is no longer confined to excavation material. For instance, the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) in the United Kingdom has recorded find spots for over 412,000 coins, according to Pett (2014) as cited in Gruber and Meadows' ""Numismatics and Linked Open Data"" (ISAW Papers 20.6, 2021). This has led to new works of synthesis and the growth of material is not showing signs of abatement. Furthermore, the ability to map coins from their source to deposition provides evidence for movement, connectivity, and economic circulation, offering new opportunities for research.",10
156,In what ways can the iconographic and epigraphic repertoire of ancient coinage be used to study various aspects of ancient society and administration?,"The iconographic and epigraphic repertoire of ancient coinage can be used to study various aspects of ancient society and administration by examining the intentions of the issuers of the coins and the preconceptions of the users. This can provide insights into areas such as local religion, imperial economic policy, individual political ambition, and communal statements of identity. By analyzing the iconography and inscriptions on coins, researchers can uncover patterns of administration that may not be visible through other sources.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods. A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.15, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meadows-gruber/.","The iconographic and epigraphic repertoire of ancient coinage can be used to study various aspects of ancient society and administration in several ways. It can be used to examine areas from local religion to imperial economic policy and from individual political ambition to communal statements of identity. The evidence from the findspots of these coins can be combined with the iconography of the objects to expose patterns of administration that are invisible from other sources. This approach has been demonstrated in recent work by Kemmers (2006) and von Kaenel and Kemmers (2009). Furthermore, the process of die-study can be used to determine how many dies were used to strike a given coinage, providing a way to quantify ancient monetary production (Gruber and Meadows, ISAW Papers 20.6, 2021).",10
157,"What are some of the challenges in exploiting numismatic data for research, particularly in terms of data volume and diversity of descriptions?","Some of the challenges in exploiting numismatic data for research include the sheer volume of data available, as there are millions of coins across various collections and sources. Additionally, the diversity of descriptions poses a challenge as coins are described in different systems, formats, standards, and languages, making it difficult to integrate and analyze the data effectively.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods. A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.15, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meadows-gruber/.","Exploiting numismatic data for research presents several challenges, particularly in terms of the sheer volume of data and the diversity of descriptions. Many coins are described online, but they are described in different systems, formats, standards, and languages, making it difficult to consolidate and analyze the data (Meadows and Gruber, ISAW Papers 7.15). Additionally, the data is located in a variety of institutional and non-institutional settings, adding another layer of complexity to its exploitation (Gruber and Meadows, ISAW Papers 20.6). Furthermore, many finds of Roman-era coinage are known but are described in only vague terms often without detail even on the exact number of coins which were found, making it very difficult to perform any usable analysis on the material (Hoyer, ISAW Papers 13, 2018).",9
158,"How has the Linked Data approach been applied to Roman numismatics, and what are the benefits of this approach for the field?","The Linked Data approach has been applied to Roman numismatics through projects like nomisma.org, which provide stable URIs for numismatic concepts and enable the linking of numismatic data within Roman numismatics and beyond. By using discipline-specific terms and common identifiers, such as Pleiades URIs and Wikipedia links, the integration of numismatic data into broader fields of study is facilitated. This approach allows for the creation of a graph of Roman coin data that is interconnected and can be linked to other resources. The benefits of this approach include improved data integration, easier access to reusable information, and the ability to create interactive tools for analysis and representation of numismatic data, such as timelines and maps. Additionally, the use of Linked Data simplifies the updating and management of data, making it easier to incorporate new collections and information into the system.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods. A Case Study of Linking a Discipline"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.15, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meadows-gruber/.","The Linked Data approach has been applied to Roman numismatics through the development of infrastructure for creating linked Roman numismatic data, a process initiated by the American Numismatic Society in 2011 in collaboration with strategic partners (ISAW Papers 7.15, Andrew Meadows and Ethan Gruber).

The Linked Data model is well-suited to the publication of collections, finds, and reference works in the field of numismatics (ISAW Papers 20.6, Gruber and Meadows). Existing projects with well-developed databases do not need to change their recording practices or software, making the cost of admission to the Linked Data community for Roman numismatics low. This approach benefits the field by allowing all to benefit at little or no cost without the need to surrender their own working practices (ISAW Papers 7.15, Andrew Meadows and Ethan Gruber).",10
159,How does the creation of a type corpus like Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE) enhance research possibilities in Roman numismatics?,"The creation of a type corpus like Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE) enhances research possibilities in Roman numismatics by allowing for the linking of multiple examples of a given coin type from various contexts. This capability opens up new avenues for research as researchers can now access and analyze a broader range of examples of a specific coin type. Additionally, OCRE's Linked Data approach enables the integration of data from various projects, such as collections and hoards, enriching the information available for study and analysis. The multilingual interface and the ability to link to individual specimens in public collections further enhance the depth and breadth of research possibilities in Roman numismatics.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods.

The Linked Data approach used in the creation of OCRE also enables the aggregation of specimens from an international range of museum and archaeological databases, making them accessible through OCRE. This approach opens up new possibilities for research, including the visualization of changes in average weight of denarii between the late Roman Republic and early Empire, and the mapping of the distribution of findspots for specific types directly within OCRE and CRRO. The OCRE project, as described by Gruber and Meadows in ""Numismatics and Linked Open Data"", also facilitates the creation of similar projects in the future, expanding the potential for research in the field of numismatics.",10
160,"How are stable URIs and discipline-specific vocabularies used in the Linked Data approach to numismatics, and how do they facilitate data integration and analysis?","Stable URIs and discipline-specific vocabularies are used in the Linked Data approach to numismatics to provide unique identifiers for numismatic concepts and terms. These URIs allow for the creation of a graph of Roman coin data that is linked within Roman numismatics and can also be linked to broader datasets in the ancient world. By using discipline-specific terms and common identifiers, such as Pleiades URIs or Wikipedia links, data integration across different fields of study becomes possible.

These stable URIs and vocabularies facilitate data integration and analysis by ensuring that numismatic data can be linked and interconnected within the field of Roman numismatics and beyond. This allows for the seamless exchange of data between different projects and databases, enabling researchers to analyze and synthesize information from various sources. The use of Linked Data architecture, RDF databases, and SPARQL endpoints further enhances the ability to query and analyze numismatic data, making it easier to manage and update datasets for improved research outcomes.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods.

This allows for the creation of a graph of Roman coin data that is linked within Roman numismatics by the use of discipline-specific terms. It also facilitates joining the broader graph of ancient world data through the use of common identifiers. This approach enables the integration of data from various sources, such as different collections or archaeological datasets, and facilitates analysis by providing stable connections between objects and typological records that describe them.",9
161,"What are the advantages of linking type corpus records to hoards and collections in numismatic research, and how does this interconnectedness benefit the field?","Linking type corpus records to hoards and collections in numismatic research allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the context and distribution of coins. By establishing these connections, researchers can enrich databases with detailed descriptions of coin types, find spots, and individual specimens. This interconnectedness benefits the field by enabling researchers to analyze the characteristics of individual types or coins issued in specific locations or by particular rulers. It also allows for comparative studies, such as examining the frequency of certain depictions on coinages of different emperors. Additionally, this linkage facilitates the creation of tools for analyzing the characteristics of coins and types, enhancing research capabilities within the field of numismatics.  2014,""Coinage and Numismatic Methods.

164,"How did burial practices in the Roman Empire change over time, specifically in relation to cremation and inhumation?","Burial practices in the Roman Empire changed over time in relation to cremation and inhumation. Initially, cremation was the most popular form of burial during the early Roman Empire, with inhumation being a secondary option. However, by the mid-2nd century, the frequencies between cremation and inhumation had reversed. By the 4th century, cremation had become a rare practice in the Roman Empire. This shift in burial practices over time reflects changes in societal norms, beliefs, and cultural influences within the Roman Empire. Katy M. Meyers 2014,""Exploring an Opportunity to Link the Dead in Ancient Rome"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.16, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/meyers/.","During the Roman occupation, burial practices varied greatly based on factors such as region, citizen status, social rank, family beliefs, and religious cult affiliation. At the start of the Roman Empire, cremation was the most common form of burial, with inhumation being a secondary option. However, by the mid-2nd century, the popularity of these two forms had reversed. By the 4th century, cremation had become a rare practice (Nock 1932). Despite the strong Roman cultural influence, there was a great diversity in the types of burials throughout the empire due to imperial tolerance, which did not mandate a specific type of burial (Toynbee 1996). The only stipulation was that burials must take place outside the city walls, but the choice between cremation or inhumation was left to the mourning community (Meyers, ISAW Papers 7.16, 2014).",8

179,How does the author describe the role of ontologies in organizing knowledge and enabling automated inference?,"The author describes ontologies as formalized structures used for organizing knowledge in Computer Science. Together with a knowledge base and a reasoner, ontologies form an expert system that enables automated inference over a given dataset. By publishing data in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats with clear URIs, systems can share knowledge effectively. The linking of datasets through ontologies allows for enriched datasets by accessing relevant information from external data streams across the Web.

182,Can you provide an example case study mentioned in the article that tests the ontological representation of Sumerian literature narratives?,"One example case study mentioned in the article is the composition ""Three Ox-drivers of Adab."" This composition is considered to be humorous and has a narrative structure with repetitive patterns within a frame story. The representation of this narrative was limited to the first 35 lines due to the incomplete nature of the latter part of the piece. The story involves three friends from Adab who seek justice from the king after a dispute. They are ox-drivers, each owning different animals, and face a dilemma regarding the ownership of a calf born in their absence. The king seeks the advice of a ""cloistered lady"" to solve the riddle, but the composition remains fractured and incomplete, leaving the audience in suspense without closure.

183,What are some of the challenges and decisions that arise when representing the narrative content of Sumerian literature through ontological structures?,"Some of the challenges and decisions that arise when representing the narrative content of Sumerian literature through ontological structures include:

1. Deciding on the level of realism: Determining how to represent the narrative content realistically within the ontological structure, considering that the events are fictional but set in a historical context like the city of Adab.

2. Character representation: Defining fictional characters as instances of a specific class (e.g., omb:Character) and attributing them with unique qualities and relationships, such as alliances and enmities.

3. Complex events representation: Handling complex narrative events, such as the ox-drivers' decision to seek justice, and deciding whether to treat them as instances of a specific subclass (e.g., ome:Social) within the ontological structure.

4. Focalized storytelling: Addressing the issue of focalized storytelling, where the narrative is based on the memories and retelling of events by characters like the ox-drivers and the king, leading to the concept of ""composite memory.""

These are just a few examples of the challenges and decisions that need to be considered when representing the narrative content of Sumerian literature through ontological structures. Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller 2014,""Assessing the suitability of existing OWL ontologies for the representation of narrative structures in Sumerian literature"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.18, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/nurmikko/.","Representing the narrative content of Sumerian literature through ontological structures presents several challenges and decisions. Firstly, the narrative events, although fictional, are set in historical contexts, such as the city of Adab, and adhere to the natural laws of our reality, requiring no suspension of disbelief from the reader. This necessitates careful decision-making in the representation of the narrative and the fabula (Bal, 2009). Secondly, the narrative may be a composite of several accounts, requiring amalgamation in the representation. The project also involves issues of Knowledge Representation, Description Logic, Coreference, and uses tools like SPARQL, RDF, URIs and OWL. Two OWL ontologies, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) and Ontomedia (OM), were evaluated for their suitability in representing cultural heritage data and narrative structures. The large and complex structure resulting from this process needs to be reduced to match the data available from the ETCSL. The ontology is also to be extended to allow for the mapping of bibliographical data and the representation of literary tools such as similes, metaphors and analogies (Nurmikko-Fuller, ISAW Papers 7.18, 2014).",7

The BPS model allows individual or collaborating researchers to approach a single corpus with different assertions, which can result in variant disambiguations. However, the assignment of unique identifiers to disambiguated individuals poses a challenge for BPS, which continues to investigate the application of unique identifiers to the results the tools generate.",10
188,How does the BPS disambiguation model work in determining real-world person correspondences to name instances?,"The BPS disambiguation model works by positing a unique person for each name instance in each document and then attempting to collapse persons into one another based on user-configured rules that operate on various features of each original person. These features include filiation, activity, roles, and dates of activities. The rules of the model can shift weight from one person to another, boost the effect of applied shift rules, or discount the effect of applied shift rules. The end result is a set of probabilities for each name instance, indicating the set of real-world persons to which that name instance may correspond. Researchers can configure their confidence in each rule and review the results in the UI, deciding to confirm or discard the model's outcomes. Additionally, researchers can make assertions to override the computed results, specifying that a given name-citation is or is not the same person as another name-citation.  2014,""Berkeley Prosopography Services"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.19, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/pearce-Schmitz/.","The BPS disambiguation model works by initially positing a unique person for each name instance in each document. The model then attempts to collapse these persons into one another, such that the persons posited for name instances that refer to a given real-world person are collapsed into a single person in the model. The model produces weighted probabilities for each name-instance in a document, which researchers can review and decide to confirm or discard. The model also allows for the application of rules that provide additional evidence for a match or counter-indication. These rules can be applied within a document (intra-document rules) or across the corpus (inter-document rules). The results of the disambiguation process may vary as it reflects the computation of an algorithm defined by each user (Pearce and Schmitz, ISAW Papers 7.19, 2014).",9
189,What are the three functions of the rules in the BPS disambiguation model?,"The three functions of the rules in the BPS disambiguation model are:
1. Shift rules: These rules shift weight from one person to another.
2. Boost rules: These rules magnify the effect of applied shift rules.
3. Discount rules: These rules reduce the effect of applied shift rules.  2014,""Berkeley Prosopography Services"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.19, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/pearce-Schmitz/.","The rules in the BPS disambiguation model serve three main functions. Firstly, they are used to provide evidence for a match between name instances, which is modeled as a boost. This often leverages features like location or activity. Secondly, they provide evidence of counter-indication, which is modeled as a discount. This includes date rules that consider the typical lifespan and span of activity, along with the dates of respective activities. Lastly, the rules can apply to person/names within a document (intra-document rules), or to persons across the corpus (inter-document rules) (Berkeley Prosopography Services. Laurie Pearce and Patrick Schmitz. ISAW Papers 7.19 (2014)).",7
190,How do researchers interact with the disambiguation model in BPS to confirm or discard results?,"Researchers interact with the disambiguation model in BPS by reviewing the weighted probabilities produced for each name-instance in a document in the user interface. They can then decide to confirm or discard the results of the model by making assertions. These assertions are modeled as actions that can override the computed results, similar to a boost or discount. Researchers can also set a confidence level on each assertion, allowing them to control how the heuristic proceeds and explore different scenarios.  2014,""Berkeley Prosopography Services"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.19, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/pearce-Schmitz/.","Researchers interact with the disambiguation model in BPS by reviewing the weighted probabilities for each name-instance in a document that the model has produced. They can then decide to confirm or discard the results of the model. These decisions are modeled as an action that the model can take to override the computed results, operating like a boost or discount. The user can optionally set a confidence on each assertion, so it may be more of a hint than a conclusion on their part. Other researchers working with the same corpus can accept selected assertions from a peer and apply them in their own workspace, and reject or ignore those with which they do not agree (Berkeley Prosopography Services. Laurie Pearce and Patrick Schmitz. ISAW Papers 7.19 (2014)).",9
191,What is the challenge faced by BPS in implementing Linked Open Data (LOD) and how are researchers addressing this challenge?,"The challenge faced by BPS in implementing Linked Open Data (LOD) is related to assigning unique identifiers to disambiguated individuals due to the mutability of results generated by the probabilistic tools. Researchers are addressing this challenge by investigating the application of unique identifiers to the results generated by the tools in order to make use of Linked Open Data effectively.  2014,""Berkeley Prosopography Services"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.19, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/pearce-Schmitz/.","The Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) faces a challenge in implementing Linked Open Data (LOD) due to the assertion model, which complicates the assignment of unique identifiers.

However, it is mentioned in ""Origins and Antidotes of Omission: Southeastern European Archaeology, Linked Open Data, and the Possibilities for Archaeological Integration"" by Hunnell Chen and Folsom (ISAW Papers 20.12, 2021) that researchers in data-intensive fields are developing and discussing practical solutions to common challenges of Linked Data, including maintaining and sharing datasets and creating connections between differently-developed and separately-maintained datasets.",8
192,How does BPS differ from other prosopography tools and projects in terms of handling probabilistic heuristics and individual researcher assertions?,"BPS differs from other prosopography tools and projects by formalizing and integrating the probabilistic heuristics that prosopographers naturally apply in their research. It provides a workspace environment where individual or collaborating researchers can approach a single corpus with different assertions. Each modification may result in variant disambiguations, which the researcher can explore and either accept or reject. This flexibility in handling probabilistic heuristics and individual researcher assertions sets BPS apart from other tools and projects in the field of prosopography.  2014,""Berkeley Prosopography Services"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.19, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/pearce-Schmitz/.","Berkeley Prosopography Services (BPS) differs from other prosopography tools and projects in its approach to probabilistic heuristics and individual researcher assertions.

200,How has the PAS website utilized structured data and metadata tags for enrichment of resources?,"The PAS website has utilized structured data and metadata tags for the enrichment of resources in various ways. They have implemented microformats, RDFa, FOAF standards, Schema.org, and Facebook's OpenGraph metadata tags extensively within their HTML templates. Additionally, they have used Twitter cards for concise previews of content. By incorporating these structured data elements, they have enriched their website with dynamic data drawn directly from their database, providing aggregated biographical pages and enriching coin guides with additional information. The PAS has also linked external identifiers to their vocabulary and authority lists, allowing for a more comprehensive enrichment of resources. Daniel E.J.

203,"What challenges are faced by scholars studying the ancient city of Pompeii, according to the article?","According to the article, scholars studying the ancient city of Pompeii face challenges related to the vast and uneven archive of scholarship. Information about Pompeii has been ignored, neglected, destroyed, and left unreported and unpublished. The excavation and scholarship of Pompeii prove to be difficult due to the scattered nature of published materials across various libraries and archives, making it challenging to discover relevant sources. Additionally, the high cost and limited distribution of important publications like the Nova Bibliotheca Pompeiana have hindered the study of Pompeii. Eric Poehler 2014,""Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Resource"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.21, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/poehler/.","According to Eric Poehler in ISAW Papers 7.21, scholars studying the ancient city of Pompeii face numerous challenges. The vast and uneven archive of scholarship is spread across the world in hundreds of libraries and archives, hidden in obscure and defunct journals, travel diaries, monographs, and illustrations. The excavation and scholarship of Pompeii prove a nightmare of omissions and disasters, with each generation discovering the extent to which information has been ignored, neglected, destroyed, and left unreported and unpublished. Additionally, the high cost of books and their physical format limit the organization and wide distribution of its contents. Furthermore, there is a perennial problem of poor quality, lack of standardization, and differing interpretations of space in published maps.",10

208,How does the PBMR combine bibliographic analysis tools with spatial analysis tools to enhance research capabilities?,"The PBMR combines bibliographic analysis tools with spatial analysis tools to enhance research capabilities by allowing users to vacillate between spatial analysis tools and bibliographic analysis tools. This process produces results that are impossible to achieve through any other method. Users can conduct multilingual searches for specific terms, such as ""House / Casa / Haus / Maison,"" and receive hundreds of citations along with highlighted locations on the map. By filtering these results spatially, users can refine their search based on specific criteria, such as the area each house occupied. This combination of spatial and bibliographic analysis tools allows for nuanced and data-rich results in a matter of minutes, providing extensive documentation for specific research inquiries.

211,"What challenges do students face when trying to conceptualize time in the past, according to the article?","Students face challenges when trying to conceptualize time in the past, especially when it comes to the conventional temporal divisions or ""periods"" used to group and categorize the art, archaeological remains, and historical events of the ancient world. The article mentions that students sometimes struggle to place objects within a historical, archaeological, or art-historical period and to assign corresponding date ranges. The article also notes that students may feel like they are picking terms and dates at random when asked to do so. This difficulty in understanding ancient time is attributed to the fact that developments that took place over centuries appear to have happened all at once, creating a sense of confusion and a flattening of ancient time. Additionally, the article highlights that the idea of ""periods"" is essentially arbitrary conventions about which scholars disagree, making it challenging for students to grasp the periodization of the ancient world. Adam Rabinowitz 2014,""It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.22, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/rabinowitz.","According to Adam Rabinowitz in ""It's about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data"" (ISAW Papers 7.22, 2014), students face several challenges when trying to conceptualize time in the past. One of the main difficulties is the arbitrary nature of periods, which can lead to confusion and the belief that the periodization of the ancient world is impossible to learn. The conventional temporal divisions or periods used to categorize the art, archaeological remains, and historical events of the ancient world can be hard to grasp. The situation is further complicated by the imprecise dates of historical periods, especially as one moves further back in time. The boundaries and names of these periods can differ from culture to culture and from scholar to scholar, and can also change over time as new evidence is collected or new historical paradigms are adopted.",9
212,"How has the Linked Ancient World Data environment utilized conceptual entities like people, places, and texts?","The Linked Ancient World Data environment has utilized conceptual entities like people, places, and texts as the foundations for a growing infrastructure that makes it easier to discover semantically-related information. Authoritative spatial gazetteers like the Pleiades platform have enabled the extraction of maps from texts by matching place names to geographic coordinates. This has facilitated initiatives like the Pelagios Project to bring together material associated with the same site in different databases. The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for people, places, and things has helped in overcoming barriers to discovery created by different metadata schemata, vocabularies, or languages. This approach has enhanced the ability to link information across various datasets and sources in the Linked Ancient World Data environment. Adam Rabinowitz 2014,""It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.22, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/rabinowitz.","The Linked Ancient World Data environment has utilized conceptual entities like people, places, and texts as foundations for its growing infrastructure. It uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for these entities to sidestep barriers to discovery created by different metadata schemata, vocabularies, or languages.

For instance, different names for Athens must refer to the same socio-political unit located at the same geographic coordinates. Authoritative spatial gazetteers like the Pleiades platform have made it possible to extract maps from texts by matching place names to geographic coordinates. They have also provided a conceptual connection that initiatives such as the Pelagios Project have used to bring together material associated with the same site in different databases (Rabinowitz, ISAW Papers 7.22, 2014).",10
213,"Why have periods proven to work poorly with Linked Data principles, according to the article?","Periods have proven to work poorly with Linked Data principles because individual periods are considered concepts of convenience, often invented by a single scholar and then modified and debated over time. They are deliberately left vague in temporal terms to protect their usefulness for relative chronologies. This lack of objective existence and the varying definitions of periods by different scholars make it challenging to establish well-defined entities for linking, which is a requirement for Linked Data principles.

They also have spatial boundaries and are often bounded by events, adding to their complexity. This complexity and lack of objective existence make periods difficult to reconcile in different datasets and to represent as structured data in Linked Data models.",9
214,How did the development of GeoDia lead to the realization of the need for a different approach to periodization?,"The development of GeoDia led to the realization of the need for a different approach to periodization because the original design of GeoDia focused on archaeological and art-historical periodization. However, problems arose when attempting to use a generic periodization approach, as it led to conflicts between the date ranges of periods and the history of specific sites. For example, the case of Pompeii, which existed during the ""Flavian period"" but was abruptly ended by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79, highlighted the limitations of a generic periodization model. This led to the development of a data model where the basic unit was the ""site period,"" representing a local manifestation with a site-specific date range of a more general period concept. This shift in approach highlighted the complexities and idiosyncrasies of periodization, prompting the need for a more flexible and site-specific method of defining periods. Adam Rabinowitz 2014,""It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.22, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/rabinowitz.","During the development of GeoDia, an interactive spatial timeline of ancient Mediterranean history and archaeology, Adam Rabinowitz encountered the problem of periodization. He found that using a generic periodization could lead to sites being represented with periods that were not used to describe them in the literature. For example, though Pompeii exists during the more general Flavian period, that site ends abruptly in AD 79, in the middle of that period, with the eruption of Vesuvius. This led to the realization that a different approach to periodization was needed, one that recognizes the fact that different scholars can conceptualize the same time range or cultural phenomenon quite differently, while others use the same terms to describe time ranges or cultural phenomena that differ to varying degrees. This led to a data-model in which the basic unit was the site period, in most cases a local manifestation, with a site-specific date range, of a more general period concept.

The first datatype includes statements that identify temporal and spatial boundaries for a period term according to a particular authoritative source, which were initially called definitions but are now labeled periods. The second datatype consists of sets of definitions expressed by the same authoritative source, initially called collections but now referred to as authorities. The model allows users to contribute new periods to existing authorities or to contribute new authorities. The data interface has been redesigned to improve spatial and temporal visualizations, searching and browsing, and to facilitate the creation of new authorities and periods by users. The period assertions are presented in a JSON-LD schema that includes the term or label used by the source, a date range expressed in Julian Days in scientific notation, an associated geographic entity from a Linked Data gazetteer, and an authoritative source linked to a URI.",8
220,How does the article propose to build a community of contributors to the PeriodO gazetteer?,"The article proposes to build a community of contributors to the PeriodO gazetteer by using Github to house the repository initially. It will provide user-management tools to allow authoritative users to add their own URIs for period definitions they prefer. This approach aims to encourage contributions from scholars and users to the gazetteer, fostering a community of practice around period assertions.

The success of this initiative will depend on the development of a scholarly community of practice, with members willing to implement period assertion URIs in their own datasets and contribute new period assertions to the gazetteer. This approach is seen as a grassroots starting point to explore possibilities (Adam Rabinowitz, ISAW Papers 7.22 (2014) and ISAW Papers 20.3 (2021)).",9
221,"What model of publication is currently being followed by publishers of archaeology, according to the text?","Publishers of archaeology are currently following the ""Steampunk model"" of publication, which involves using 21st-century technology to produce 18th-century books and journals in both print and digital editions.

232,"How are canonical citations defined in the context of Classics, and why are they important for scholars in the field?","Canonical citations in the context of Classics are the standard way of citing primary sources, which are ancient texts. They are essential for scholars in the field because they provide a precise and interoperable way of referring to texts. This accuracy is crucial for scholarly discourse about texts, as it allows scholars to refer to specific sections of texts without being concerned about variations in pagination or layout across different editions or translations. Canonical citations are designed to link the citing text with the cited text, making them important artifacts that establish clear connections between different sources. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","Canonical citations are the standard way of citing primary sources, such as ancient texts, in the field of Classics. They are designed to refer to texts in a precise and interoperable way, allowing scholars to refer to specific sections of texts without concern for variations in pagination or layout across different editions and translations. This precision is crucial because texts are the fundamental object of philological research, and scholarly discourse about these texts requires an accurate way of referring to them. Canonical citations also serve as a way of linking the citing text and the cited text, making explicit links that already exist in the text. These citations are important for scholars as they allow for the tracking of how and how often texts were studied over time, providing essential information for a data-driven study of the discipline and its evolution (Romanello, ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",10
233,"How does the author approach the extraction of citations from texts, and what are the key entities identified in the process?","The author approaches the extraction of citations from texts by performing two tasks: Named Entity Recognition (extraction) and Named Entity Disambiguation. In this process, the author identifies four key entities: aauthor, awork, refauwork, and refscope. These entities help in capturing the different components of a citation and any mention of ancient authors and works occurring in the context surrounding the citation itself. The goal is to establish a relation between these entities to accurately extract and understand the citations from the texts. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","The author, Matteo Romanello, approaches the extraction of citations from texts by using state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques, adapted to the new domain of citation extraction. This process involves two steps: capturing the strings that constitute the citation and establishing the specific section of text to which the citation refers, also known as Named Entity Disambiguation. Instead of only considering the usual named entities such as names of people, places, and organizations, Romanello treats the different components of a citation as named entities. Four distinct entities are identified in this process: aauthor, awork, refauwork, and refscope. A citation is defined as a relation between any two of these entities, where one is always the indication of the citation's scope (refscope) and the other can be any of the other entities. Once captured, citations are disambiguated by assigning to each citation its corresponding CTS URN (Romanello, 2013; ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",10
234,What is the significance of disambiguating citations by assigning them corresponding CTS URNs?,"The significance of disambiguating citations by assigning them corresponding CTS URNs lies in the ability to create a standardized and unique identifier for each citation. This process allows for precise identification and retrieval of digital representations of texts, making it easier to link and reference specific sections of texts across different editions and translations. By using CTS URNs, citations become interoperable and can be resolved to the correct portion of text in any available edition or translation, ensuring accuracy and consistency in scholarly references. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","The significance of disambiguating citations by assigning them corresponding CTS URNs lies in their ability to serve as unique, persistent, and location-independent identifiers for textual data. As explained by Thomas Koentges et al. in ""The CITE Architecture: Q & A Regarding CTS and CITE"", these identifiers can be used to reference specific passages of text, allowing for precise citation in both print and digital formats. This system facilitates the work of annotators, commentary writers, and readers, who can use these identifiers without needing to know about each other. Furthermore, as Matteo Romanello explains in ""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"", CTS URNs are designed to be the digital equivalent of canonical citations, making it possible to identify and retrieve digital representations of texts.",10
235,How is a knowledge base of canonical texts utilized to validate automatically extracted citations and prevent errors?,"A knowledge base of canonical texts is utilized to validate automatically extracted citations and prevent errors by storing detailed information about the citable structures of each text. This information includes all possible abbreviations of the name of an author or the title of a work, as well as structural details like the number of books or chapters in a specific text. By querying this knowledge base, researchers can validate the automatically extracted citations and identify errors. For example, if a citation includes an incorrect number of hierarchical levels, the knowledge base can help flag it as an invalid citation. This process helps ensure the accuracy of extracted citations and prevents common errors that may occur when working with OCR texts lacking structural markup. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","A knowledge base of canonical texts is utilized to validate automatically extracted citations by storing detailed information about the citable structures of each text, such as the number of books in a work or the number of chapters in a book. This allows for the identification and correction of citations that are not valid, such as those that reference a non-existent section of a work. For example, a citation that appears to reference a fourth hierarchical level in Thucydides Histories, which only has three levels, would be identified as incorrect. This system is particularly useful when working with OCRed texts, where structural markup may be lacking and errors in citation are common (ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",10
236,"How are extracted citations published as Linked Open Data, and what is the role of annotations in this process?","Extracted citations are published as Linked Open Data by representing them as annotations using the Open Annotation Data Model. Each extracted citation is created as a new annotation where the string containing the citation becomes its label, and the citing and cited texts become its target and body, respectively. The annotations clarify the reason for creating them, which is typically for identifying the object (i.e., text section) identified by a given citation. Annotations play a crucial role in making the links between the citing text and the cited text explicit and interoperable within the Linked Open Data framework. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","Extracted citations are published as Linked Open Data by representing them as annotations, as defined by the Open Annotation Data Model. This approach was largely inspired by the Pelagios Project. For each extracted citation, a new annotation is created where the string containing the citation becomes its label, and the citing and cited texts become its target and body, respectively. These relationships are expressed by the oac:hasTarget and oac:hasBody properties (ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",10
237,How does the author address the issue of making canonical citations interoperable in a digital environment?,"The author addresses the issue of making canonical citations interoperable in a digital environment by assigning each citation its corresponding CTS URN. This practice allows for the identification and retrieval of digital representations of texts. The CTS URNs are identifiers that follow the Uniform Resource Name standard and were developed within the Multitext Homer project as part of the CITE architecture. This approach aims to establish a digital equivalent of canonical citations, enabling the linking of citations to digital texts effectively. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","The authors address the issue of making canonical citations interoperable in a digital environment by transforming them into hyperlinks or resolvable pointers that can be resolved to a given portion of text in any available edition or translation. This is done through the use of the CITE architecture, which assigns unique identifiers to work-group, work, version, and each part of a text, making it canonically citable. The authors also mention the use of a knowledge base to support the disambiguation of canonical citations, which contains detailed information about the citable structures of each text. This information is then stored and published online as Linked Open Data (Heath and Bizer 2011). (ISAW Papers 7.24 (2014), ISAW Papers 20.8 (2021))",7
238,What role do ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo play in structuring the knowledge base for canonical texts?,"Ontologies like CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo play a crucial role in structuring the knowledge base for canonical texts. They provide a framework for modeling information related to classical texts, including canonical citations. These ontologies help in organizing data about authors, works, citations, and other relevant entities in a structured and standardized manner. Additionally, when the existing ontologies do not fully meet the requirements, extensions like the HuCit ontology are created to enhance the modeling of data specific to the domain of canonical texts. Overall, these ontologies ensure consistency, interoperability, and accuracy in representing and querying information within the knowledge base. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","Ontologies like CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo play a significant role in structuring the knowledge base for canonical texts. The CIDOC-CRM, for instance, is used as a standard for organizing data in cultural heritage information systems and is often used in the publication of archaeological data. It is also used in the representation of cultural heritage data and narrative structures, as mentioned in the research project by Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller (ISAW Papers 7.18, 2014). The FRBRoo ontology, on the other hand, is suitable for modeling information related to Classical (canonical) texts, as it has influenced the design of the CTS protocol (ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",8
239,How are extracted citations linked to digital representations of texts in the Perseus Digital Library and the Classical Works Knowledge Base (CWKB) resolution service?,"Extracted citations are linked to digital representations of texts in the Perseus Digital Library and the Classical Works Knowledge Base (CWKB) resolution service through an intermediate object called ""hucit:TextElement."" This abstract object identifies a citable element within the hierarchical structure of a text and is linked via the ""hucit:resolves_to"" property to digital representations of the cited passage. These digital representations include editions and translations available in the Perseus Digital Library and via the Classical Works Knowledge Base resolution service. The URIs of these digital representations are not strictly LOD-compliant as they do not resolve to an RDF representation of the resource identified by the URI. However, linking to these resources is considered the first necessary step towards LOD compliance, with the hope that the underlying technology will eventually align with LOD principles. Matteo Romanello 2014,""Mining Citations, Linking Texts"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.24, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/romanello/.","The Perseus Digital Library uses a system of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to link extracted citations to digital representations of texts. These URIs leverage Canonical Text Services (CTS) URNs, which allows the library to take advantage of the CTS data model while still supporting Linked Data standards. Individual passage citations can be retrieved at URIs which adhere to a specific syntax. However, it is noted that these URIs do not yet resolve to an RDF representation of the resource identified by the URI, which is not strictly LOD-compliant (ISAW Papers 7.3 (2014), Bridget Almas, Alison Babeu, and Anna Krohn; ISAW Papers 7.24 (2014)).",7

241,"What was the aim of the SAWS Project, and how was it funded?","The aim of the SAWS Project was to explore the tradition of Greek and Arabic wisdom literatures by examining Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings' and relating them to their sources, to each other, and to texts that used them. The project aimed to create links between these sayings to form the core of the project. The SAWS Project was funded by HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) under a call to explore Cultural Dynamics.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The SAWS Project, Sharing Ancient Wisdoms: Exploring the Tradition of Greek and Arabic Wisdom Literatures, aimed to examine Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings', and relate them both to their sources (largely in Greek and Arabic literature), to one another, and to texts which made use of them with these links making up the core of the project. The project was funded by HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) under a call to explore Cultural Dynamics (Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom, ISAW Papers 7.25, 2014, Charlotte Rouechu00e9, Keith Lawrence, and Faith Lawrence).",10
242,Why was the linked data approach important in the study of Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings'?,"The linked data approach was important in the study of Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings' because the authoring scribe of these collections was free to modify them, resulting in similar but distinct variations. By using linked data, researchers could relate these sayings to their sources, to each other, and to texts that made use of them, providing insights into philosophical traditions and cultural interactions represented in these collections.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The linked data approach was important in the study of Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings' because it allowed for the examination of these collections in relation to their sources, to one another, and to texts that utilized them. This approach was used in the SAWS Project, Sharing Ancient Wisdoms, which was funded by HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) to explore Cultural Dynamics. The project aimed to explore the philosophical traditions and cultural interactions represented in these collections, which were often modified by the authoring scribe, resulting in similar but distinct variations (ISAW Papers 7.25, 2014, ""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" by Charlotte Roueché, Keith Lawrence, and Faith Lawrence).",10
243,"What was the unit of analysis in the study, and how did the researchers label each item?","The unit of analysis in the study was a 'saying', as identified and presented by the scribe of a particular manuscript. The researchers labeled each item by working closely with the CTS project over the last 18 months to generate unique ids for each saying.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The context does not provide specific information on what the unit of analysis in the study was, or how the researchers labeled each item.",1
244,"What constraints did the researchers face when linking to sources, and how did they enrich their texts with other linked data?","The researchers faced constraints in linking to sources because they were limited by what was available at the time. They were able to extensively use texts in Perseus but identified many items for which there was no text available to link to. They had hoped to link to items in the TLG canon, but this was not yet possible. To enrich their texts with other linked data, they included links to the new Perseus catalog or VIAF for authors, used Pleiades for places, linked to the Prosopography of the Byzantine World and the Paregorios list of Roman emperors for people named as actors, and added as many links as possible to online versions of the materials cited in the bibliography.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The researchers faced several constraints when linking to sources. For instance, they hoped to link to items in the TLG canon, but found it was not yet possible (ISAW Papers 7.25, 2014). Despite these challenges, they were able to enrich their texts with other kinds of linked data. They included links to the new Perseus catalog or to VIAF for authors. For places, they used Pleiades and were able to add some new locations, which allowed them to join Pelagios (ISAW Papers 7.25, 2014).",8
245,How did the researchers aim to balance the use of machine-readable links with a welcoming environment for human readers?,"The researchers aimed to balance the use of machine-readable links with a welcoming environment for human readers by enriching their texts with various kinds of linked data. They included links to resources like the Perseus catalog, VIAF, Pleiades, Prosopography of the Byzantine World, and Paregorios list of Roman emperors. Additionally, they tried to enrich the bibliography with links to online versions of the materials being cited. The goal was to make the fullest possible use of links in machine-readable form while ensuring a user-friendly environment for human readers.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The researchers aimed to balance the use of machine-readable links with a welcoming environment for human readers by embedding links and reading tools that are easy to implement from an author's or publisher's perspective. They also aimed to create a multi-dimensional text that adds practical improvements to the printed word, delivering more robust content more quickly to the reader. They stressed the importance of keeping the general reader in mind, who should be able to find and use online data and its underlying relationships without a second thought of how it all came to be. They also tried to enrich their bibliography with as many links as possible to online versions of the materials being cited, while also creating an environment that is welcoming for human readers (ISAW Papers 7.23 (2014), ISAW Papers 7.25 (2014)).",7
246,What potential benefits did the researchers hope to achieve by using linked data in their study?,"The researchers hoped to achieve benefits such as examining Greek and Arabic collections of 'sayings' in relation to their sources, to each other, and to texts that used them, creating a resource that makes the fullest possible use of links in machine-readable form while also being welcoming for human readers, and potentially leading to a slow steady improvement in accuracy by allowing direct access to referenced texts and identifying incorrect or mistaken references.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The researchers hoped to achieve several benefits by using linked data in their studies. According to Hafford (ISAW Papers 7.7, 2014), linked data could make research faster and easier, and reduce duplication of effort. Seifried (ISAW Papers 7.26, 2014) saw the potential for highlighting relevant and meaningful relationships between data points that would otherwise remain isolated. Chen and Folsom (ISAW Papers 20.12, 2021) discussed the practical solutions linked data provides for maintaining and sharing datasets, and creating connections between differently-developed and separately-maintained datasets. McMichael (ISAW Papers 7.14, 2014) highlighted the benefits of collaboration and networking with similar projects. Michelson (ISAW Papers 20.10, 2021) emphasized the value of querying and analyzing both individual data points and the network of relationships between them. Kansa (ISAW Papers 7.10, 2014) suggested that linked data could promote professional recognition and open new research opportunities. Finally, Bodard (ISAW Papers 20.4, 2021) pointed out the potential for new discovery and research across the dataset, detection and proposal of matching across records, new identifications, alignment, and annotation by scholarly and crowdsourcing communities.",4
247,How did the researchers address incorrect or mistaken references through the use of linked data?,"The researchers addressed incorrect or mistaken references through the use of linked data by working in a way that allowed them to go directly to the text being referenced. This direct linking to the source text could reveal incorrect or mistaken references, leading to a slow and steady improvement in accuracy.  2014,""Linked Data and Ancient Wisdom"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.25, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/roueche-lawrence-lawrence/.","The researchers addressed incorrect or mistaken references through the use of linked data by transforming citations into hyperlinks. This process allows for direct access to the text being referenced, making it easier to identify and correct any inaccuracies. Additionally, the use of linked data can lead to a slow, steady improvement in accuracy as it enables the linking of data, which can highlight incorrect or mistaken references (ISAW Papers 7.25, 2014). However, it's important to note that this method may lead to a misrepresentation of the nature of citations, as they are designed to be interoperable and should not be tied to a specific edition or translation (ISAW Papers 7.24, 2014).",9
248,What are some of the challenges faced by scholars who are unfamiliar with linked open data when it comes to publishing archaeological data online?,"Some of the challenges faced by scholars unfamiliar with linked open data when it comes to publishing archaeological data online include violating best practice guidelines for born-digital data, not structuring datasets for individual record metadata, and struggling with the technical aspects of coding RDF triples or using web languages like HTML or SPARQL. Additionally, there may be difficulties in understanding how to connect data to the semantic web and making data accessible and meaningful to a broader audience. Rebecca M. Seifried 2014,""Linked Open Data for the Uninitiated"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.26, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/seifried/.","Scholars who are unfamiliar with linked open data face several challenges when it comes to publishing archaeological data online. According to Rebecca M. Seifried in ""Linked Open Data for the Uninitiated"" (ISAW Papers 7.26, 2014), one of the main difficulties is the technical aspect of creating and managing linked open data, especially for those who do not have a background in web languages like HTML or SPARQL. Additionally, there is the issue of adhering to best practice guidelines for born-digital data. Seifried also mentions the challenge of understanding the basic premises of linked open data and structuring datasets in a way that can be easily converted into this format by specialists. Furthermore, the ""Publishing Archaeological Linked Open Data: From Steampunk to Sustainability"" (ISAW Papers 7.23, 2014) paper highlights the need for education about the potential of new media and existing technology in documenting archaeological work.",8
249,"How does the author suggest that uninitiated archaeologists prepare their data for online publication, even if they are not familiar with coding RDF triples?","The author suggests that even if uninitiated archaeologists are not familiar with coding RDF triples, they should prepare their data to be archived in an online, open-access format. This involves structuring datasets so that specialists can later convert them into linked open data in a relatively easy process. By following best practice guidelines for data acquisition and compilation, uninitiated archaeologists can make their data accessible for online publication, even without coding RDF triples themselves. Rebecca M. Seifried 2014,""Linked Open Data for the Uninitiated"" ISAW Papers, vol. 7.26, http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/seifried/.","The author suggests that uninitiated archaeologists prepare their data for online publication by understanding the basic premises of linked open data and structuring their datasets in a way that specialists can later create linked open data in a relatively easy and painless process. The author also emphasizes the importance of determining which specific types of data will be relevant to a broader audience and preparing for data to be archived in an online, open-access format. The author further recommends that authors of preliminary excavation reports or final reports provide their readers with links to complete data sets, which can be used as a reference and checked for errors (Rebecca M. Seifried, ISAW Papers 7.26 (2014)).",9
